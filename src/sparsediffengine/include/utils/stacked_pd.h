   permuted_dense blocks. Two different blocks have disjoint row permutations,
   but the column permutations may overlap across blocks.

   `src_block_idx_p` and `src_block_idx` form a CSR-style map (offsets + flat
   data) from each output block to the source block indices that contribute to
   it in the spd-producing operations that built this spd. For operations with
   one source per output every entry of `src_block_idx_p` increments by one. For
   coalesce a single output block can be fed by multiple source blocks. */
