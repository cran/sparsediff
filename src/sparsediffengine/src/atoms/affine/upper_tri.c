/* Extract strict upper triangular elements (excluding diagonal)

 * NOTE: This is an exception to the engine's column-major
 * convention. CVXPY's upper_tri iterates row-by-row across
 * columns (i outer, j inner), so we do the same here for
 * compatibility.
 *
 * For an (n, n) column-major matrix, element (i, j) with
 * i < j is at flat index j * n + i.
 * Output has n * (n - 1) / 2 elements. */
